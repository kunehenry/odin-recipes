    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These flatbreads are great on the breakfast table, for lunch and make a perfect accompaniment for dinner. They are easy to make over an open fire, on the barbecue or on the cooker if you prefer. You can flavour the recipe to your taste using different types of flour, moisture, herbs etc. In the Longhouse we especially like wholemeal flatbreads with beer.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Servings: 4 portions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup rye flour</li>
        <li>1 cup barley flour</li>
        <li>1 cup wholemeal flour</li>
        <li>1 cup whey, but yoghurt or beer will do nicely as well</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Water as needed. The dough should be elastic, but not stick to the table.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Mix the different flours with salt, whey and water to form a springy dough. Let it rest for 30 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Knead one portion of this basic dough well and add the flavours you like. See our suggestions below.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make 8 small flatbreads about 1 cm thick. Sprinkle with flour and let them rest for another 20 minutes. In the meantime you want to heat up a frying pan over a fire, on the barbecue or on the cooker.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake/cook the flatbreads on a dry pan over medium heat (live coals) till golden brown.</p></li>
    </ol>
