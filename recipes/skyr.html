    <img src="https://www.196flavors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/skyr-4.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Skyr is a dairy product originating from Iceland. It is known in Sweden as färskor. Its particularity lies in its thick and rich consistency and its high protein content. Often compared to Greek yogurt, skyr has a milder and smoother flavor. This traditional thick yogurt is usually served cold, with sugar.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Servings: 1 liter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>4 quarts skimmed milk</p></li>
        <li><p>¾ cup plain skyr</p></li>
        <li><p>7 drops liquid animal rennet (or 4 drops liquid vegetarian rennet)</p></li>
        <li><p>¼ cup lukewarm water (at 97 F / 36°C)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Start by carefully sterilizing all the utensils needed to prepare the skyr. This includes the whisk, bowls, cups, spoons, cheesecloth, etc.</p></li>
        <li><p>Do this either by rinsing them in boiling water, or by immediately taking them out of a dishwasher cycle at 170 F (75°C) minimum.</p></li>
        <li><p>Clean the thermometer tip.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a non-stick saucepan, bring the milk to a boil, at a temperature between 185 F and 210 F (85°C and 100°C) maximum.</p></li>
        <li><p>To do this, place the milk in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a slow, steady boil over medium-high heat, heating it until it comes to a boil.</p></li>
        <li><p>This step should take about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir the milk regularly with a metal spoon to prevent it from sticking or burning.</p></li>
        <li><p>Towards the end of this step, if the milk starts to stick to the bottom of the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low and stop stirring.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn off the heat immediately after the milk has reached its boiling point.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove the pan from the heat and allow the milk to cool to a temperature of 115 F (45°C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour the plain skyr into a bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the milk has cooled, pour 1 cup (250 ml) of cooled milk over the skyr and mix.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place this mixture in the saucepan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour the liquid rennet into lukewarm water and whisk, then immediately pour this mixture into the milk while whisking (the rennet loses its effectiveness very quickly).</p></li>
        <li><p>This mixture should sit for 12 hours before proceeding to the rest of the recipe.</p></li>
        <li><p>To do this, cover the pan with a thick cotton cloth and place it in a warm, draft-free place for 12 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>During these 12 hours of rest, the curd separates from the whey, which is necessary for the manufacture of skyr.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour the curd thus obtained into the cheesecloth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Hang the cheesecloth on a roasting pan in a cool room, or place the cheesecloth in a colander over a large bowl in the refrigerator. Allow the remaining whey to drain until the skyr is ready, and is very thick.</p></li>
        <li><p>The skyr will keep for 3 weeks, covered, in the refrigerator.</p></li>
    </ol>
